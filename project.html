                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>Many individuals now rely on filters and photo editing tools to enhance their appearance and create a specific persona or image. However, this can lead to <span class="bold">several adverse effects on mental and physical health</span>, including the development of eating disorders such as anorexia and so on. People feel an impact, whether it be poor body image, general pressure, or increased isolation.</p>
                        <h3>Why Does it Matter</h3>
                        <p>90% of participants in a City University of London felt pressured to look a certain way and use filters. Filters create unattainable standards, <span class="bold"> linked to negative body image, low self-esteem, and isolation</span>, especially in younger people new to the online world.</p>
                        <p>It is important to address the impact of filters on mental and physical health and promote an inclusive culture that values diversity and individuality. By acknowledging both positive and negative impacts of filters and photo editing tools, people can create a society where <span class="bold"> people feel valued for who they are</span>, not just how they look.</p>
                        <p>It is important to address the impact of filters on mental and physical health and promote an inclusive culture that values diversity and individuality.

                        <h3>Our Goal</h3>
                        <p>Raise awareness about the prevalence of heavily filtered content on social media, and the negative mental health impact it garners. We propose steps towards remedying the issue and believe it could result in a shift in the way people post on Instagram towards a more <span class="bold">authentic and real environment</span> in the future.</p>

                        <h2>Research</h2>
                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <ul class="percentages">
                            <li><span class="percentage">70%</span> people feel pressure to showcase a “perfect life”</li>
                            <li><span class="percentage">94%</span> people feel under pressure to look a particular way on social media</li>
                            <li><span class="percentage">86%</span> people replied that social media representations does not reflect their real life</li>
                            <li><span class="percentage">80%</span> girls have downloaded a filter or used an app to change the way they look in photos by age 13</li>
                        </ul>  
                        <p>Young adults who frequently use filters often have increased feeling of dissatisfaction with their appearance. They judge themselves not only against celebrities, but their own filtered appearance. While some filter usages can help, research demonstrates that using filters with the intent to better ones appearance on social media has a negative mental health impact.</p>
                        <h3>User Research</h3>
                        <p>While filters may be the root cause of the issue, their impact is further compounded by individuals' inability to differentiate between manipulated and unedited images. In our research, we discovered that participants could only accurately identify altered images 60% of the time. We conducted several user interviews and found that a significant majority of participants expressed a <span class="bold"> desire for greater clarity regarding the authenticity of photos.</span></p>
                        <p>Consequently, we investigated the potential effects of providing Instagram users exclusively unfiltered images, in tandem with increasing awareness about the ubiquity and effects of extreme filters.</p>

                        <h3>Main Design Oppertunities</h3>
                        <p>By acknowledging and addressing both the positive and negative impact of filters and photo editing tools, people can promote a healthier and more accepting society, where individuals feel valued and accepted for who they are, rather than how they look. This can be achieved through education and <span class="bold">awareness-raising campaigns, promoting body positivity and self-love, and encouraging the use of more realistic and inclusive images</span>  in media and advertising. By working towards a culture that values diversity and individuality, we can create a more accepting and inclusive culture that celebrates diversity and individuality.</p>
                        <p>The option to filter ones feed to only certified unedited content provides the opportunity to <span class="bold">self-regulate their exposure to potentially harmful edited content.</span> This fundamentally shifts a users experience on the platform, allowing them to interact with more natural and authentic content.</p>
                        <p>Through the <span class="bold">InstaCam</span> feature, users have the option to take photos on the Instagram app and <span class="bold">upload them as content or verify their camera roll images</span> are unaltered through a verified machine learning algorithm. Through either of these processes, they will receive a #NoFilter icon for their post. </p>
